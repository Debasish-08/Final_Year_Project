# Final_Year_Project
Heartbeat Audio Disease Detection using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting cardiovascular diseases from heartbeat audio recordings using machine learning. By analyzing the phonocardiogram (PCG) signals ‚Äî which capture the sounds produced by the heart ‚Äî the system can classify whether a heartbeat is normal or abnormal, potentially assisting in early diagnosis of heart conditions.

üîç Project Overview
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project utilizes machine learning to analyze PCG (heartbeat) audio recordings and automatically detect signs of cardiac abnormalities.

The pipeline includes:

Audio pre-processing

Feature extraction

Machine learning classification

Evaluation of model performance
